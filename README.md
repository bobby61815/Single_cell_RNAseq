# Introduction
In the past decade,

# Methodology
I first downloaded the raw 3K PBMC scRNAseq data from [2] and used the scvi-tools to separate doublet and singlet [3]. Then, I used UMAP to cluster cells into different groups. Based on the gene expression pattern on those groups, I separated 3K PBMC sample into several groups, including NK cell, CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell.
